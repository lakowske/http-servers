# http-servers
An apache http server with builtin tls certificate generation

# Purpose

This project is a simple way to create a web server with a self-signed certificate. 
It is useful for testing purposes, or for creating a quick web server for a small project.

# Guidelines

1. Relative paths are assumed to be relative to the project root unless specifically defined otherwise.

  Examples:
  - 'config.yaml' is the same as '/path/to/project/config.yaml'
  - 'tests/dev-config.yaml' is the same as '/path/to/project/tests/dev-config.yaml'
